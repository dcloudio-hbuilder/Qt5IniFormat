Combined LICENSE for Qt5IniFormat

This repository contains a mix of code: some files are derived from
Qt sources (which carry their own copyright and license headers),
and other files in this project are released into the public domain.

Summary
-------
- Files that include the Qt copyright/license header (and thus are
	distributed under the terms described in those headers) are:
	- `qt5iniimpl.h`
	- `qt5iniimpl.cpp`

	Those files include the following notice and are available under
	The Qt Company licensing terms (LGPL v2.1 or v3) with the Qt
	Company LGPL Exception 1.1 as stated in their file headers:

	"Copyright (C) 2015 The Qt Company Ltd."

	See the headers in the files above for the complete license text and
	exception. Also refer to:
	- https://www.qt.io/licensing/
	- https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html
	- https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html

- All other files in this repository are released into the public
	domain under the Unlicense (the original content of this `LICENSE`
	file). The Unlicense text is included below.

Notes
-----
- This combined LICENSE clarifies that some source files are derived
	from Qt and are therefore subject to the Qt/LGPL terms shown in
	their headers. You cannot relicense those files under a different
	license without complying with the Qt licensing terms or replacing
	the derived code.
- If you want the entire repository to use a single license, you must
	either replace the LGPLed Qt-derived files with code you own or
	obtain a compatible relicense from the copyright holder.
